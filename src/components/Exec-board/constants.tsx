        description: "I received my undergraduate degree in biology and psychology at Barnard College of Columbia University. I completed my medical training at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and my general pediatrics residency at UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital. I currently serve as the Chair of the UCLA Santa Monica Patient Family Centered Care Committee as well as the pediatric clerkship site director at Mattel Children's Hospital. I am also the director of the Sub-I for general and complex pediatric care at Mattel Children's Hospital and Santa Monica Medical Center. I was recently appointed an Educator for Excellence at the David Geffen School of Medicine and am active in the development of the medical school curriculum. My interests focus on medical student education, improvement of family bedside rounds, and improving communication with Spanish speaking families. I began working with PULSE in 2015 when we incorporated pediatrics into the rotations. Then I became the Faculty Chair. It has been such a rewarding experience working with all the students. I know that when I was an undergraduate opportunities in the medical field influenced my decision to become a future pediatrician. It is exciting to teach the students during rounds and show them a glimpse into a career a medicine. I am always impressed by their clinical symposium presentations and how far they come throughout each quarter."

        title: "Director of Hospital Operations", 
        description:"PULSE has been instrumental to my growth as a student-leader and as a first-generation student pursuing a future within healthcare. As someone who came to UCLA lacking the knowledge and resources it takes to succeed academically and professionally, the community, mentorship, and professional development PULSE offers were fundamental to my sense of conviction in knowing that I belong within this space. After my first year in PULSE, I knew that I wanted to give back to the club and cultivate a space for members to grow personally and professionally. Serving as the Director of Hospital Operations and leading this incredible organization over the past year has been a challenging feat, but I am extremely proud of the progress we have been able to make and the direction the organization is heading towards. Facilitating shadowing opportunities, overseeing the different projects board members put on, and mentoring my Co-Director, Joseph, have been incredibly rewarding. I am grateful to call everyone I have crossed paths with my family!"

        title: "Director of Hospital Operations", 
        description:"If there’s one thing I could tell any student remotely interested in a career within healthcare, it would be to join PULSE. It sounds incredibly cliche and trite, but it’s such a rarity to come across a group of highly ambitious and goal-oriented people, nevertheless those that hold as much compassion and support for others as my peers in this organization. I count myself deeply lucky to have been able to surround myself with them for my years at UCLA. Along the same vein, working with my Co-Director Ali Al-Saleem has truly been a rich and rewarding experience—whether that’s fostering relationships between physicians and students, listening to members rave about their stories on shift, or hunkering down to organize shadowing for the quarter. In every major aspect, I am indelibly bettered because of my opportunity to serve as a Director of Hospital Operations. My hope now is to continue to give back to PULSE all that I have been given, this year and the next."

        description:"My role as the Director of Fundraising is incredibly fulfilling, as it allows me to craft engaging experiences for PULSE members while raising vital funds for pediatric research through St. Baldrick's Foundation. Being part of the PULSE community has profoundly influenced me, offering a blend of professionalism and camaraderie. Through diverse professional development events and insightful shadowing experiences at RRMC, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the healthcare field, appreciating the collaborative essence of medicine. Furthermore, PULSE's socials and outreach events have provided a sense of belonging and support within the premedical community at UCLA, fostering an environment that uplifts and empowers. I aspire to deepen my comprehension of research funding mechanisms and explore innovative approaches to orchestrate successful fundraising initiatives."

I have been tasked with organizing different volunteering events so members can also contribute to giving back to their communities.

With such a large cohort we can offer much our time to assisting and attending these events so there are volunteers who can actively participate is resource to these communities. Even by offering our time in attendance we can help maintain events occur with helping with other minute activities."

        description:"PULSE has exposed me to a diverse array of patient-physican interactions, providing invaluable insight into the realities of patient care. Following each patient's clinical course alongside the care team has not only affirmed my desire to pursue medicine, but also to apply the biopsychosocial model of assessment and treatment. I am passionate about promoting a holistic perspective of the medical field and hope to foster learning about the social determinants of health through the Student Research Program. Therefore, it is especially rewarding to lead the PULSE Clinical Symposium, which gives students the chance to present case studies and engage in meaningful discussions with healthcare professionals. Ultimately, I am extremely thankful to be surrounded by such a supportive community and look forward to all of the exciting opportunities for personal and professional growth this year!"

        description:"As one of the Directors of St. Baldrick’s, I help organize the many moving parts throughout the year that go into making our annual Brave the Shave event possible! Our St. Baldrick’s Committee raises funds and awareness for childhood cancer by connecting with the greater LA community, local businesses, and the Mattel Children’s Hospital.  My experiences in PULSE have fostered and affirmed my decision to pursue a career in medicine. PULSE has helped me gain a more intimate insight into the physician-patient relationship and explore a diverse range of specialities. By enriching my understanding of the healthcare field, PULSE has introduced me to new interests to which I have continued to explore within research and other opportunities! So many of my experiences in PULSE in shadowing and our professional development events further examine the many aspects of healthcare, including social determinants of health, to help educate us on a holistic view of medicine. One of the most notable parts of my PULSE experience has been the wonderful and diverse community from which I am so grateful to learn from each and every day!"

        description:"PULSE has fostered my professional development by challenging me to think about medicine and social health in a multifaceted manner. Med students, residents, and attending I have met through PUlSE have offered me invaluable insight and advice that have helped me grow as a future medical professional. The most rewarding part of PULSE outside of being a part of the most amazing community of people is being able to learn from so many different people including mentors and peers alike. More so, being able to put on Brave the Shave in support of children with pediatric cancer through PULSE has been immensely eye opening and has been challenging and gratifying all in one."
